Today, a particularly stressful day at work, a came across several E-Mail and IM threads about [Google Gears][1] with my friends and colleagues. I finally had the time to look into it more seriously and I feel I should point out that I don’t share the global excitement everyone seems to suffer from.

Google Gears anticipates what [browsers should have already][2] and clones what [Zimbra envisioned months ago][3], I fail to understand the wow effect, really. I had that wow when Zimbra [demoed the concept over at eTech 2007][4]. Sure, it’s Opensource, and works with almost all platform combinations, and I’m not saying it isn’t neat either, but stop the presses please,  what about these questions ?

- What will it happen when Firefox 3 supports off line storage natively ? What’s the point on disseminating something that I hope, will be deprecated within the next browser’s major releases ? Or will it use the Gear’s API ?

- Why should anyone download and install software on their computers to get these features ? Not the masses, that’s for sure. It’s hard enough to get your users to upgrade to decent browser, trust me.

- Since Google is such a big sponsor of Firefox. Why aren’t they heading their energy on getting offline storage   onto FF early and making sure IE, Opera and Safari adopt the same APIs for a change ?

Seems like a “we’ll think about that later” situation to me. Maybe I’m just edgy today, or missing something here.
