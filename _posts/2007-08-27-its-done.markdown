excerpt: "Courage, persistence and hard-work will always make the impossible, possible. Took me about 6h30m hours of unprecedentedly (nano)hardware fiddling, with soldering skills I wasn’t aware I had (no needles, that sucked too), but fuck, I did it. Geohot‘s method, fully unlocked, not the silvercard/supersim crap. Works. Check the gallery. off to bed now."
