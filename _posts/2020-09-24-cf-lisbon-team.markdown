It's happening. The Cloudflare Lisbon office is growing, and I'm excited to announce we just opened **six new positions** for a new engineering team we’re creating.

We’re specifically looking for candidates based in Lisbon. This team will be working on data insights and special projects for Cloudflare. We operate with small groups of highly motivated and experienced software, data science, and network engineers who like to solve problems, and we work to meet both the challenges of a massively growing customer base and our internal department's needs.

These jobs will report to [me][9] and [@jgc][8].

- [Backend Engineer][1]
- [Data Scientist][2]
- [Frontend Engineer][3]
- [Full Stack Engineer][4]
- [Machine Learning Engineer][5]
- [Software Engineer][6]
