title:  "SAPO Messenger for Mac, Public Beta"
date: 2007-05-8 00:05:00
excerpt: "This is worth a note. After almost two years of development we’re finally gone public with our SAPO Messenger for Mac and are going high-profile on it. It’s been one of the must fun projects on the company, much to be learned from it (a making-of story is a must on this one, I’m convincing João, Pedro and the rest of the crowd to make one). The project is also Opensourced, also one of the biggest commitments and investments we’ve made with the community so far. So enjoy, we did."

It’s been one of the must fun projects on the company, much to be learned from it (a making-of story is a must on this one, I’m convincing João, Pedro and the rest of the crowd to make one). The [project is also Opensourced][2], also one of the biggest commitments and investments we’ve made with the community so far. So enjoy, we did.
