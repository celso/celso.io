So, recently I became a member of the home 3D printers early starters community and got myself an Ultimaker.

I thought I’d do a time-lapse video of the whole assembly process, including the first 3D print.

It took me 3 days to complete the building instructions but the result is pretty awesome.

Congratulations to the Ultimaker team for making such a wonderful machine and putting together such great documentation, I still think it’s a miracle this thing actually printed an almost perfect black cube at the first attempt.

The time-lapse was made using a Canon 5DM2 camera and software, Time Lapse Assembler, Final Cut Pro X and Garage Band for composing the music. Enjoy.
