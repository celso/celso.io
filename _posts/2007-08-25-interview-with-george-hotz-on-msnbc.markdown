[Geohot’s accomplishment][1] is all over the web my now so I won’t comment on it any further but this [MSNBC live interview with him][2] is worth watching. George is an remarkable hardware guy but above all, it’s his motivation and his ethics that are worth mentioning. He’s a true hacker.

I and a few friends actually followed the whole story on IRC live, when he wrote the step-by-step tutorial on the Blog. In fact, we were so intoxicated with the story, that we decided to do an unlocking marathon later at my place. The result was a disaster, do not attempt to do this unless you’re a soldering expert, really (see [this pic][3] for a good idea on the size of these circuit tracks). I’ve modded a few consoles in the past and I was very confident but what I saw was insane. And by the way opening the iPhone wasn’t  easy too. So we were stuck in step 3 and wen’t back to the drawing board. Idiots. We have a video of this, I’ll edit it and post it soon, for your amusement.

Either way, [software unlocking][4] is popping up [everywhere][5] so we’re happy we just scratched one iPhone and called it off for the night.

Oh and one more thing. If you really want to open it here’s two tutorials: A [video from pdaparts][6] (we used this one, so you know it sucks. They skip a lot of details) and a [really good one][7] I found later.
