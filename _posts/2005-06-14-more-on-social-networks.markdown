A few days ago, I [blogged about FOAF][1]. Since then I’ve been more aware to simple solutions/approaches to the social face of the technical web. A few days after I stumbled across [XFN][2] /XHTML Friends Network), another very simple way to represent social relationships through annotations on the most used presentation language on the Internet: HTML. What else is out there ?
In the lack of a widespread adopted mechanism to represent user data and human relationships, there are many proposals laying around waiting for fame and fortune:

Personal Data Representation:

[FOAF][3] – Friend of a Friend[VCard][4] – Electronic Business Card[XMDP][5] – XHTML Meta Data Profiles[Profile JEP][6] – Jabber Profile JEP proposal

Relationship representation:

[XFN][2] – XHTML Friends Network[FOAF][3] – Friend of a Friend[XMPP][9] – Jabber’s Rosters ![:)](/assets/more-on-social-networks-1.jpg ":)")

Centralized Services:

[Orkut][10] – Connects people through a network of trusted friends[Friendster][11] – Orkut’s clone[Yahoo 360][12] – Friendster’s clone[RubHub][13] – XFN Relationship Lookup Engine
