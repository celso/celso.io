I told you [rfc2397 was good][1] for offline storage didn’t I ? [Here’s a program][2] ([source][3]) that generates two bookmarks. Each of those are actually javascript programs customized with your [PT-WIFI][4] credentials.

Bottom line, you can save these bookmarks on your iPhone’s Safari browser and once you have PT-WIFI coverage you’re one-click away to instant log on. No more clumsy, painful web redirects or forms to fill in. Very handy.

Once you get the idea, you can make your own version for your local WIFI operator.
