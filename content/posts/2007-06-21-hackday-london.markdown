Everything has been said about [Hackday London][1] already, so I’ll skip the detailed description bit. This is just a quick note to say that [BBC][2] and Y! rocked. We had loads of fun and learned a lot too.

The [hack that we submitted][3] didn’t won any prize, so we were clearly robbed there (maybe if the timer guy hadn’t shut us down during our presentation, bah…) but still a very big thumbs up to anyone [on the list][4], to the jury, [the winners][5], and to [ourselves too][6]. .pt rules.

Now seriously, Yahoo! has gotten the Hackday formula well tuned by now. Not even [the thunderbolt episode][7] or the problems with BT Openzone’s Wifi on Saturday were enough to spoil the party. Definitively something I’ll be thinking about during the next weeks to evaluate something similar, but in a Portuguese context, we’ll see.
