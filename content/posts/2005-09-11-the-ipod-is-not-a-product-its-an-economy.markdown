excerpt: That’s right. Like cellphones, the iPod has long entered the accessories
  scam market. In fact, the iPod it self is not even Apple’s big profit but instead
  the economy that lives around it. Proof of it is that the accessory count as reach
  1000! Don’t you just hate when all your investment goes down the toilet when that
  new cool cellphone or iPod just suddenly changes the PC connector or battery charger
  adapter for no other reason than to revitalize a whole new series of gadgets and
  make money out of our vulnerable pockets ?
