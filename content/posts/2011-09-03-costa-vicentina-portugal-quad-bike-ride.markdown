excerpt: A couple of years ago I bought a quad bike for fun and pleasure to play around
  the beautiful southwest coast of Portugal, more precisely the Costa Vicentina, near
  Aljezur where I own a house. Years passed through and between less visits to the
  southwest, a busier life, kids and other hobbies, I had temporarily forgotten how
  amazing the experience can be.

A couple of years ago I bought a quad bike for fun and pleasure to play around the beautiful southwest coast of Portugal, more precisely the Costa Vicentina, near Aljezur where I own a house. Years passed through and between less visits to the southwest, a busier life, kids and other hobbies, I had temporarily forgotten how amazing the experience can be.

Recently I bought a goPro camera, great device, and a bunch of accessories to go with it too. So the last weekend I thought it would be a great opportunity to take the quad out of the garage, take a ride around the inaccessible coast roads of Aljezur and show you the breathtaking places most people don’t know about this region and most cars can’t go, like secret desert beaches, natural preserved lakes and other awesome spots.

I took the time and patience and experimented with a lot of the camera accessories, mounting the goPro in different places on the bike and different configurations and I gathered some ~30 gigs of 720p footage. Also I’m learning more and more FCPX techniques so this was a great chance to improve my skills. This is the edited result. Hope you like it.
