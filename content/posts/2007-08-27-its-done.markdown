excerpt: Courage, persistence and hard-work will always make the impossible, possible.
  Took me about 6h30m hours of unprecedentedly (nano)hardware fiddling, with soldering
  skills I wasn’t aware I had (no needles, that sucked too), but fuck, I did it. Geohot‘s
  method, fully unlocked, not the silvercard/supersim crap. Works. Check the gallery.
  off to bed now.
